# VEGETARIAN RECIPES

SPA that enable you to find vegetarian recipes.

## :question: Why

This project is the final practice for start2impact React.js course.<br>

After studying and practicing step by step through tutorials, it's important to create your own project to actually practice.
Vegetarian recipes website

The website you will create is designed for vegetarians. In fact, within the site the user will have the possibility to search exclusively for vegetarian recipes through the spoonacular API. Note that you will need to specify parameters to receive only certain categories, so read the documentation carefully.

API: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs

Here's what the site should include:

Search bar that allows you to search for all vegetarian recipes.
Each recipe searched for must show at least the title and cover image.
Clicking on a recipe will take you to a dedicated page, where more information will be displayed.
Simple and easy to use UI and UX.
Structure of the app organized and understandable.
Responsive design.

Even if the website you will create is not complex, it would be better to use some of the technologies you have studied.

React Router
Axios
React Hooks
Redux or Context API
